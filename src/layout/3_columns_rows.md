# Columns and Rows

The two most important structs for laying out widgets are [`Column`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Column.html) and [`Row`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Row.html).

Both lay out their children in one direction. The column organizes the widgets vertically and the row horizontally.

By default, they align the items in the top left corner of their space.

A convenient way to create columns and rows is with the [`column!`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/macro.column.html) and [`row!`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/macro.row.html) macros.

We saw one of them in the [Minimal Application - Counter](../quickstart/3_a_simple_counter_app.md).
```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../quickstart/snippets/main.rs:row}}
```
There, we created a [`Column`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Column.html) with three children inside. One text and two buttons. The syntax for rows is the same.

You can put any [`Element`](https://docs.rs/iced_core/0.10.0/iced_core/struct.Element.html) inside a [`Column`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Column.html) or [`Row`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Row.html).

## Alignment

Of course, we can change the horizontal alignment for columns and the vertical alignment for rows.

![Column and Row Example](assets/column_row_center.drawio.svg)

This is how they would align in the center.

In code, if you want to set the [`Alignment`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/enum.Alignment.html) you can call the [`align_x`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Column.html#method.align_x) method on your column/row. It will return itself with the new alignment.
```rust, ignore
let some_column = iced::widget::column![
    iced::widget::text("Hello World!"),
    iced::widget::text("Another Hello World!")
].align_x(iced::Alignment::Center)
```

## Spacing

Since you can not set a margin in iced and often want to have a spacing between elements.

Columns and rows have the [`spacing`](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/widget/struct.Column.html#method.spacing) method to set the spacing.

Here is an example of how to use spacing on a column:
```rust, ignore
let some_column = iced::widget::column![
    iced::widget::text("Hello World!"),
    iced::widget::text("Another Hello World!")
].spacing(20)
```

## Wrapping

Rows can do one thing that columns can't. They are able to wrap. You can activate row wrapping by calling `.wrap()` on them.

When activated, children are layouted different. If the horizontal space is filled with some children, the ret placed in a new row below.
Children with a width set to `Fill`/`FillPortion` will fill all remaining horizontal space, and thus resulting in a row break. Children with a fixed/shrink width are placed next to each other until the horizontal space left is not enough leading to a row break.
